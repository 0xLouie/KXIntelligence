- Analysis of transaction velocities and intervals

**Transaction Flow Analysis**
- Real-time visualization of fund movements
- Tracking of multi-hop transactions
- Exchange deposit pattern analysis
- Detection of splitting and merging patterns

**Risk Assessment**
- Wallet risk scoring based on behavior patterns
- Exchange interaction analysis
- Suspicious pattern flagging
- Historical pattern correlation

**Advanced Visualization**
- Interactive transaction flow diagrams

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.0.0 or higher)
- npm package manager
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage Guide

### Transaction Analysis

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Enter a Solana wallet address or Solscan transaction ID
   - Analyze complete transaction chains
   - Track fund movements across multiple hops

2. **Flow Visualization**
   - Interactive network graph of transactions
   - Color-coded nodes for different wallet types
   - Temporal transaction mapping
   - Pattern highlighting

### Timing Analysis

The platform employs sophisticated timing analysis to detect money laundering:

- **Structured Timing**: Identifies patterns of transactions timed to avoid detection
- **Velocity Analysis**: Monitors the speed and frequency of fund movements
- **Correlation Detection**: Links related transactions through temporal patterns
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies known money laundering timing signatures

### Risk Assessment

1. **Automated Scoring**
   - Risk scoring based on timing patterns
   - Exchange interaction analysis
   - Historical behavior correlation
   - Pattern-based risk flags

2. **Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - Real-time pattern matching
   - Exchange flow monitoring
   - Unusual timing alerts
   - Network pattern analysis

### Data Visualization

- Interactive transaction flow diagrams
- Temporal pattern displays
- Risk score visualizations
- Network relationship graphs
